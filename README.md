# ClassOutline
Light version of ClassOutline, based on the code of FireflyMigration (Thanks to them!), and working with VisualStudio 2022.

All the options aren't available.
The context menu include constructor, view and methods, regions aren't included.
Some difference with the tollbar too.
Icons aren't include either, views are in bold.
